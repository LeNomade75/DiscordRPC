# DiscordRPC
Custom Discord RPC :
`main.py` is a process watcher that looks for specific apps being launched and then starts their associated RPC Python script.
Add your app-specific Python scripts to the **Main** folder (see `template.py` for reference).

I may add a GUI later to update the main script and automatically create new RPC Python scripts when creating new RPCs.
